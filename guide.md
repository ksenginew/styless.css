# ðŸ“– Introduction
Get started with Styless, with jsDelivr and a template starter page.

## Quick start
Looking to quickly add Styless to your project? Use jsDelivr, a free open source CDN. Using a package manager or need to download the source files? Head to the [downloads](/downloads) page.

### Installation
Copy-paste the stylesheet `<link>` into your `<head>` before all other stylesheets to load our CSS.

```html
<link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/styless@0.0.0/styless.min.css" rel="stylesheet" crossorigin="anonymous">
```

### Starter template
Be sure to have your pages set up with the latest design and development standards. That means using an HTML5 doctype and including a viewport meta tag for proper responsive behaviors. Put it all together and your pages should look like this:
```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <!-- Required meta tags -->
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">

    <!-- Styless CSS -->
    <link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/styless@0.0.0/styless.min.css" rel="stylesheet" crossorigin="anonymous">

    <title>Hello, world!</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Important globals
Styless employs a handful of important global styles and settings that youâ€™ll need to be aware of when using it, all of which are almost exclusively geared towards the normalization of cross browser styles. Letâ€™s dive in.

### HTML5 doctype
Styless requires the use of the HTML5 doctype. Without it, youâ€™ll see some funky incomplete styling, but including it shouldnâ€™t cause any considerable hiccups.
```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  ...
</html>
```
### Responsive meta tag
To ensure proper rendering and touch zooming for all devices, add the responsive viewport meta tag to your `<head>`.
```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
```
You can see an example of this in action in the starter template.

### Box-sizing
For more straightforward sizing in CSS, we switch the global box-sizing value from content-box to border-box. This ensures padding does not affect the final computed width of an element, but it can cause problems with some third-party software like Google Maps and Google Custom Search Engine.

On the rare occasion you need to override it, use something like the following:
```html
<div style="box-sizing: content-box;">
  ...
</html>
```

### Normalize
For improved cross-browser rendering, we use [modern-normalize](https://github.com/sindresorhus/modern-normalize) to correct inconsistencies across browsers and devices while providing slightly more opinionated resets to common HTML elements.
