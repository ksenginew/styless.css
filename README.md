## Get started any way you want

Jump right into building with Styless—use the CDN, install it via package manager, or download the sourcecode.

### Install via package manager

Install Styless’s source Sass and JavaScript files via npm  . Package managed installs don’t include documentation or our full build scripts.

-   Npm
    
    ```sh
    npm install styless.css
    ```
    
-   Yarn
    
    ```sh
    yarn add styless.css
    ```
    

### Include via CDN

When you only need to include Styless’s compiled CSS or JS, you can use jsDelivr. See it in action with our simple quick start, or browse the examples to jumpstart your next project.

```html
<link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/styless.css@0.0.2/dist/styless.min.css" rel="stylesheet" crossorigin="anonymous" />
```

### Starter template

Be sure to have your pages set up with the latest design and development standards. That means using an HTML5 doctype and including a viewport meta tag for proper responsive behaviors. Put it all together and your pages should look like this:

-   **HTML5 doctype**
-   **Responsive meta tag**
-   **Box-sizing**
-   **Normalize**

For next steps, use our  [examples](https://styless-git-dev-ksenginew.vercel.app/examples)  to start.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8" />
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
        <link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/styless.css@0.0.2/dist/styless.min.css" rel="stylesheet" crossorigin="anonymous" />
        <title>Hello, world!</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
    </body>
</html>
```
